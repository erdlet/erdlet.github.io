I talked about the application development with the upcoming MVC API (JSR 371) and its
reference implementation Eclipse Krazo at the [Lightweight JUG Munich](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Lightweight-Java-User-Group-Munchen/).

In addition to my talk at the JUG Ingolstadt, you'll find new slides related to the API's security aspects
and more actual information on the current status! So even you know the old slides, you'll 
learn something new!

Below you can find the talk's slides (only german):
