I talked about the application development with the upcoming MVC API (JSR 371) and its
reference implementation Eclipse Krazo at the [Lightweight JUG Munich](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Lightweight-Java-User-Group-Munchen/).

Additional to my talk at the JUG Ingolstadt, you'll find new slides related to the security aspects
of the MVC API and contains more actual information on the API etc.! So even you know the old slides, you'll 
learn something new!

Below you can find the talk's slides (only german):
